The concrete improvisations were:  

1.   Fixed the unbalanced data by changing from average (5.77) to median (0.7) as the cutoff, creating equal groups of 33 "Good" and 34 "Poor" countries.

2.  Created three specific features:  
   - Scaled population (population ÷ 1,000,000)
   - Raw station count
   - Stations per person (stations ÷ population)

3.   Compared three different algorithms:  
   - Random Forest
   - Logistic Regression  
   - SVM

4.   Optimized Random Forest   by testing:
   - 50, 100, or 200 trees
   - Different tree depths (10, 20, unlimited)
   - Different split sizes (2, 5, 10 samples)

5.   Found "stations per person"   was 57.7% of the decision, while raw station count was 23.6% and population size was 18.8%.

6.   Saved the trained model   as a .pkl file for reuse.

7.   Generated specific country recommendations   like China, India, Indonesia as top priorities.
